## Setup
1. [Install IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) if you don't yet have it. Students get Ultimate Edition for free, but Community Edition will also work for just Java development.
2. Clone our repo - `git clone https://github.com/emu-computer-science/fantasy-baseball-team2.git`
3. In IntelliJ IDEA: File > Open... and select `fantasy-baseball-team2` folder

### "Project SDK not defined"
If you see a "project SDK not defined" error bar, you need to configure JDK 13.0.1 in IntelliJ. To do this:

1. [Download JDK 13.0.1](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk13-downloads-5672538.html) (.tar.gz file) and extract/uncompress it
2. Open Project Structure dialog (click folder with 3 dots in top right corner or press Shift key twice and search for it)
3. Click "New..." under Project SDK and select JDK
4. Select the JDK folder that you downloaded and uncompressed in step 1
5. Click OK
